   Long long ago, in a galaxy far far away,
   there lived pandas who were traveling space.
   They were peaceful explorers and skilled data scientists.
   
   The pandas sent out their spaceships
   to travel the stars,
   to discover new worlds
   new tastes of bamboo no creature has tasted before
   and to plot all data they found on their way.
